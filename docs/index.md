## Description

![Schema](https://beatrizgsc.github.io/CellSegmentation/figure_1_f.png)

**Panel A**: General workflow of the proposed pipeline, part 1: (In blue, CIP-based DL: CDL). [1.1] First a weakly labelled dataset is created using conventional imaging processing (CIP). [1.2] After that, a U-net like architecture is trained and [1.3] the accuracy of the evaluated. Including an integration of the trained network in an intuitive tool for biologists that allows easy correction. 

Proposed pipeline, part 2: (In green, for Manually based DL: MDL). [2.1] Manual corrected masks are easily generated using the GUI, which is employed to train a U-net from scratch [2.2]. 

**Panel B**: The biological process of autophagy and its detection with Rosella biosensor. The four main phases are: The initial state - Phagophore, intermediate states~- Autophagosome and early autolysosome, and final state - Autolysosome. The fusion with the lysosome during the autophagy process yields a pH decrease which induces a change of colour in the fluorescent microscopy image.
